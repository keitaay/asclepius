# Build destination for compiled libraries

This folder contains libraries that have been compiled for specific OS configurations.

Folders containing build files are automatically named based on the Bash interpreter environment used to generate CMake files. Thus, their contents are not version-controlled as the user must do it for their own environment. For more information, see [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8597411).
